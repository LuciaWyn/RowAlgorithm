#Row Algorithm

To run open folder in command prompt and type:

node downTheIndex.js

Make sure to have node js installed on your device, so that it works.

Each row ends when either the array ends or when the modulus of the array index is 1 less than the number of rows.

What inspired me to write this algorithm is that I was rearranging an array for React Native, to allow for a flatlist to have separate items on different rows.
